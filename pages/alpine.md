    <h1>ESSENTIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">For students on AMGA Mountain Guide Programs</p>

    <div class="intro-section">
      <p>AMGA Mountain Guide Programs are professional training programs that teach guiding competencies across the Alpine, Rock, and Ski disciplines. AMGA programs are physically and emotionally challenging, are multiple days in length, and occur in remote mountain environments throughout rough and exposed terrain and during inclement weather.</p>

      <p>AMGA Mountain Guide Programs require students to have extensive personal mountain experience, as well as the tools, strategies, and personal capacity to independently meet the demands of the program while working effectively in a group setting and caring for themselves and others.</p>

      <p>AMGA Mountain Guide Programs are facilitated in English. While fluency is not required, the ability to understand directions and instructions, particularly in regard to risk management is required.</p>

      <p>Two main areas qualify students for participation in an AMGA Mountain Guide Program:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prerequisites</strong>—documented climbing or skiing experience and completion of previous training courses.</li>
        <li><strong>Essential Eligibility Criteria (EEC)</strong>—functions a student must be able to perform in order to participate in an AMGA Mountain Guide Program.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>A qualified Mountain Guide Program student is one who meets the EEC and prerequisites for participation in the applicable program.</p>

      <p>AMGA's EEC are designed to identify the baseline abilities required for AMGA Mountain Guide Programs in order to help students prepare to successfully and fully participate in an AMGA Mountain Guide Program. The EEC also serves as a tool for the Instructor Team to evaluate a student's performance relative to the EEC.</p>

      <p>If you are unsure if you meet or are unable to meet certain criteria, please contact the AMGA; we may be able to assist you with reasonable accommodation(s) unless doing so would change or otherwise alter the fundamental nature of the program, would present a significant health or safety risk to you, other students or instructors, or would place an undue financial or administrative burden on AMGA.</p>

      <p class="note">The following Essential Eligibility Criteria apply to ALL AMGA Mountain Guide Programs.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Each student must be able to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Care for themselves in changing environmental conditions and during long, tiring days.

        <li>Remain oriented, alert, attentive, and engaged in learning for up to 8 hours a day while in an indoor classroom setting, and up to 10+ hours a day in a dynamic outdoor environment. Though entry level courses commonly span 8 hours a day, circumstances may necessitate longer days.</li>
