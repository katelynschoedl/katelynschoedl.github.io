\begin{center}
\textbf{Electrical engineer and research coordinator with experience in hardware design for high-speed digital communication, photonic systems, and academic research processes for geophysical science applications.}
\end{center}

\setlength{\parindent}{1.5em}
My background includes avionics sensor design at Amazon, signal integrity engineering at Microsoft, and academic research coordination for geophysics and environmental sensing groups at the University of Washington. I am interested in experimental design workflows, precision measurement systems, and field operations for high-quality scientific data collection.

I am actively seeking roles in applied research and instrumentation alongside future graduate study at the intersection of hardware engineering, experimental physics, and geophysical sciences.
